# EasyFit, 1990-1991

This is the source code for a model-fitting application, developed as part of my Master's thesis in computing.  It ran on classic Macintosh; I think I started work with System 6 and ended with System 7. 

Unfortunately, I don't have a binary version around; I probably still have floppies in the basement, but I don't have a computer capable of reading them.  One day I should rebuild it; it requires the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop and MacApp.  And an emulator for the classic Mac, of course.

I updated the text files to be LF-terminated for easier viewing.  They are still encoded in [Mac OS Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman "Mac OS Roman - Wikipedia")

I include the original archive in MacBinary format -- it can be opened by Unstuffit on mac emulators.
