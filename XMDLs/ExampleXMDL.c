But if we wanted to compile				 this XMDL with the -mc68881 option, then				 it would be a good idea to check here for the				 presence of the floating point unit. 				 We could do it like this: 				 				 if (EFGetConfigRecord(block)->hasFPU)				 		block->initializeResult = kInitializeOK;				 else				 		block->initializeResult = kInitializeFailed;				 Remember that if you return kInitializeFailed, the xmdl will				 immediately be purged from memory, and you'll				 NOT receive a rFinished message.				 If you want to check for a particular version of the System				 Software, do it for instance like this:				 				 if (EFGetConfigRecord(block)->systemVersion >= 0x700)				 		block->initializeResult = kInitializeOK;				 else				 		block->initializeResult = kInitializeFailed;										 This code ensures that the XMDL will only run with System Software				 version 7.0 or higher. Remember, EasyFit forces the user to				 use at least version 6.0, so you don't need to check for that.				 If you return kInitializeFailed, EasyFit will cancel the fitting				 and issue an alert saying: "Fit failed because the external model				 is incompatible." or something similar. If your				 initialization went wrong because of a lack of memory, it is better				 to call FailNIL. This way the message will be more appropriate.				 Simlarly, if you failed to load a resource of yours, call FailNILResource				 or FailResError.			*/			block->initializeResult = kInitializeOK;			break;		case rModelName:						/* write our name */			EFWriteln(block, "This is the Example XMDL!");			EFWriteln(block, " y := p1*exp(-p2*x) ");			break;		case rGiveNParams:					/* we must say how many parameters we use */			block->NParams = 2;			break;		case rPeeling:							/* We don't provide a peeling service */			block->peelingResult = kPeelingFailed;			break;		case rModel:								/* do the real stuff */			block->y = model(block->params, block->x);			break;		case rFinalComputations:		/* we ignore it */			break;		case rFinished:							/* we ignore it */			break;	}}/* this is the "real" model code; remember that the parameters array is	 indicized from zero! */extended model(double *p, extended x){	return p[0] * exp(-p[1] * x);}/*	 This is a very important include! it contains the definitions for 	 EasyFit callbacks.
