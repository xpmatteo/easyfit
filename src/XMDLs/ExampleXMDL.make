#   File:       ExampleXMDL.make#   Target:     ExampleXMDL#   Sources:    ExampleXMDL.c#   Created:    Venerd“, 14 dicembre 1990 9:54:11OBJECTS = ExampleXMDL.c.o# explanation of linker options:## -t 'XMDL' sets the file type to the type EasyFit looks into for#           external models.## -c 'ESFT' sets the file creator to EasyFit's signature. This way#           the file's icon will be set by EasyFit.## -rt XMDL=128 sets the type of the code resource generated by the#           linker to XMDL, and the resource number to 128. Resource#           numbers are not really important. Do not confuse the#           file type with the resource type! In this case they are#           the same (XMDL), but they are really two different things!## -m Dispatch tells the linker what is the entry point (i.e.#           the first routine) in your module. This is for dead code#           stripping purposes only. The execution of your code module#           will _always_ begin with the first physical instruction in#           the module. This is because stand-alone code modules do not#           have a jump table.## -sg 'Example...' sets the name of the resource. This name will#           appear in the Model menu, so you should use a meaningful#           name.## -o 'The...' sets the name of the file. Try to choose a meaningful#           name here too, so that your users will know what's in the#           file without need to use ResEdit, or to start EasyFit.ExampleXMDL ÄÄ ExampleXMDL.make {OBJECTS}	Link -t 'XMDL' -c 'ESFT' -rt XMDL=128 -m Dispatch ¶		-sg 'Example External Model Single Exp.' ¶		{OBJECTS} ¶		"{CLibraries}"CSANELib.o ¶		"{CLibraries}"Math.o ¶		#"{CLibraries}"Complex.o ¶		"{CLibraries}"StdClib.o ¶		"{CLibraries}"CInterface.o ¶		"{CLibraries}"CRuntime.o ¶		"{Libraries}"Interface.o ¶		-o 'The Example XMDL'# use the -b compiler option to let string constants stay in the same# segment as the code#ExampleXMDL.c.o Ä ExampleXMDL.make ExampleXMDL.c EasyFitXMDL.h EasyFitXMDL.glue.c	 C  ExampleXMDL.c -b
